## Description
I created this project to quickly post my tweets on instagram as a picture, as I didn't want to keep going back and forth between the two

## How to use

Head to the releases tab and download the latest exe avaliable

if you are mac/linux user, you can run the python script directly all the code is in the main.py file

## Credits
The code is heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/xacnio/tweetcapture/blob/main/tweetcapture/examples/tweet_screenshot_to_instagram.py)

all the credits goes to the above author, I just modified it and turned it into an exe for my own personal use. Again, all the credit is reserved for the above author.

## Contribution
